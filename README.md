# cloud-classification-cnn-mobile
This project develops a custom CNN to classify clouds (e.g., cirrus, cumulus, stratus) from mobile images. The goal is to understand neural networks by building, training, and validating models using a modern framework, while practicing reproducible research and GitHub documentation.
